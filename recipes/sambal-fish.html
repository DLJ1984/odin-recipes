        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sambal is one of those ingredients that makes almost anything it touches good.
            Further experimentation is required but I'm not convinced Sambal ice-cream 
            wouldn't work. I can say with confidence that Sambal fish makes a dish worth 
            dying for...<i>assuming you're a fish and don't mind being eaten by strangers.</i></p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>600 g firm white fish fillets</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
            <li>½ tsp salt</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
            <li>steamed rice, steamed Asian greens and 
                lime halves, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sambal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 medium dried chillies, stem ends removed</li>
            <li>1 tbsp tamarind pulp</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>150g large brown shallots (about 4), peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>250g  ripe tomatoes (about 2), chopped</li>
            <li>2 ½ tsp shrimp paste (belacan), chopped</li>
            <li>2 ½ tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 red onion, cut into thin rings</li>
            <li>1 tbsp (firmly packed) shaved palm sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the sambal, tear each chili in half and shake out most of the seeds. 
            <li>Place the chillies in a bowl, pour over enough boiling water to just 
                cover then stand for 30 minutes or until the chillies are soft. 
                Drain well.</li> 
            <li>Place the tamarind pulp in a small bowl, pour over 80 ml (⅓ cup) 
                boiling water and stand for 20 minutes or until tamarind is soft. Strain the 
                tamarind mixture through a sieve into a bowl, squeezing the solids 
                with your fingers to extract as much liquid as possible - discard the 
                solids and set the tamarind puree aside.</li> 
            <li>Drain the chillies well then combine in a food processor with the 
                garlic, shallots, tomato, belacan and sugar. Using the pulse button, 
                process until a coarse paste forms, stopping occasionally to scrape 
                the mixture down.</li>  
            <li>Heat the oil in a wok over medium. Add the chilli mixture then cook, 
                stirring often, for about 12 minutes or until the most of the liquid 
                has reduced.</li> 
            <li>Stir in the onion and sugar and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes 
                or until the onion has wilted and the sugar has dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add the tamarind puree, season to taste with sea salt and freshly 
                ground black pepper then cook the sambal, stirring, for another 
                5 minutes or until any excess liquid has evaporated and the mixture 
                is thick. Keep warm.</li> 
            <li>Meanwhile, use paper towels to dry the fish. Combine the turmeric
                 and salt in a bowl, add the fish and then rub the mixture into 
                 the fish on both sides.</li>  
            <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over medium-high 
                then add the fish. Cook for 3 minutes or until golden then turn 
                and cook for another 3 minutes or until cooked through.</li> 
            <li>Transfer to a warmed serving dish, spoon sambal over each piece of 
                fish then serve with steamed rice, greens and lime.</li>
        </ol>
